<h2>3 Movies I've Enjoyed :D</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Tropic Thunder</h3>
<p>Action Comedy at it's finest, not for easily triggered folks.</p>
<br />
<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>It's a classic for a reason; so much wisdom wrapped in an adventure with Rowan Atkinson as the voice of Zazu and epic music throughout.</p>
<br />
<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h3>
<p>When you want to watch a feel-good movie with adventure and character development and great cinematography</p>
